# Pattern

**Repository:** [souraaav/pattern](https://github.com/souraaav/pattern)
**License:** Unlicense ([GitHub][1])

## 1. Project Overview

### What it is

“Pattern” is a collection of different types of patterns (presumably programming patterns or design/algorithmic patterns) implemented in one repository.

### Why it exists

* To provide reference implementations of various patterns, useful for learning or reuse.
* To help developers understand how patterns can be implemented in code (or otherwise).

### Who it’s for

* Students learning programming patterns.
* Developers looking for quick examples of pattern implementations.
* Educators who can use this as a teaching resource.

---

## 2. Features

* Multiple pattern types implemented (see folder **Different types of pattern** in repo) ([GitHub][1])
* Clean organisation: .gitignore, Credits file, Documentation.txt included. ([GitHub][1])
* Open-licensed (Unlicense) for free use, modification, distribution. ([GitHub][1])

---

## 3. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Have a development environment set up (depends on language(s) used—check the implementation files).
* A code editor / IDE.
* (If needed) A compiler/interpreter appropriate for the pattern code.

### Installation / Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/souraaav/pattern.git  
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```bash
   cd pattern  
   ```
3. Review the folder **“Different types of pattern”** to see the specific pattern implementation files.
4. Open in your IDE or run the files, according to their language.

### Usage

* Review each pattern file.
* Use or modify the implementation as needed for your project/learning.
* Add new pattern implementations by following the structure.

## 4. Project Structure

```
pattern/
├── .gitignore
├── Credits
├── Documentation.txt
├── LICENSE            ← Unlicense
├── README.md
└── Different types of pattern/
    ├── (pattern files here)
    └── ...
```

* **.gitignore** – specifies untracked files to ignore. ([GitHub][1])
* **Credits** – acknowledges contributors. ([GitHub][1])
* **Documentation.txt** – additional documentation. ([GitHub][1])
* **LICENSE** – licensing information. ([GitHub][1])
* **README.md** – this file (currently minimal) to introduce the project. ([GitHub][1])
* **Different types of pattern/** – directory containing code examples of patterns. ([GitHub][1])

## 5. Usage Guide / Examples

> *Note: Add actual examples from the codebase for each pattern. Below is a placeholder structure.*

### Example: [PatternName]

1. File: `Different types of pattern/PatternName.ext`
2. Description: Explains what the pattern does (e.g., Factory, Singleton, Observer)
3. How to run:

   ```bash
   # command to compile/run depending on language
   ```
4. Expected output:

   ```
   [example output]
   ```
5. Notes:

   * Where to customise
   * Key functions/classes
   * Best practices

Repeat this for each pattern implementation present.

## 6. Contribution Guidelines

* Please fork the repository and create your branch: `git checkout -b feature/YourPattern`
* Ensure code is well-commented and follows the repo’s style.
* Add your pattern file under `Different types of pattern/`.
* Update `Documentation.txt` with your pattern’s description, usage, and sample output.
* Submit a pull request; be ready to respond to review comments.
* Follow best practices: clear commit messages, meaningful code, tests if applicable.

## 9. Contact / Support

For questions or support, you can reach out via GitHub issues on this repository (once enabled) or contact the repository owner.

---

## 10. Roadmap / Future Work

* Add more pattern implementations (e.g., Behavioral, Structural, Creational patterns if not present)
* Include unit tests for each pattern
* Create a documentation website or wiki for better browseability
* Add code in multiple programming languages for each pattern (e.g., Java, Python, C++)
* Provide video walkthroughs or sample projects using these patterns

### Appendix

**Documentation.txt** – includes further details, perhaps design decisions or architecture notes.
**Credits** – lists contributors and acknowledgments.

> **Note:** I recommend you update the README with a clearer description of what patterns are included, add badges (e.g., license, build status), include a “Table of Contents” in the README, and use markdown formatting for code blocks, headers, and links for better readability.
