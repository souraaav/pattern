## 📁 Project Overview

The repository includes multiple pattern types such as:

- 🔷 **Star patterns** – pyramids, diamonds, right-angle triangles  
- 🔢 **Number patterns** – sequences, matrices, Pascal’s triangle  
- 🧩 **Mixed patterns** – combinations of characters and numbers  
- 📄 Each pattern is implemented in a separate file for clarity

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher  
- Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or terminal with `javac`

### 🧪 Run a Pattern

```bash
# Compile a pattern file
javac PatternName.java
