A collection of visually appealing console-based patterns created using Java. 
Perfect for beginners learning loops, conditionals, and nested structures.

---
##  Summary

This project demonstrates how to use **Java loops and logic** to generate various console patterns. 
It’s a great resource for learners and interview preparation, showcasing creativity through code.

---

##  Project Overview

The repository includes multiple pattern types such as:

-  **Star patterns** – pyramids, diamonds, right-angle triangles  
-  **Number patterns** – sequences, matrices, Pascal’s triangle  
-  **Mixed patterns** – combinations of characters and numbers  
-  Each pattern is implemented in a separate file for clarity

##  Technologies Used

-  **Java** – Core programming language  
-  **Console Output** – Text-based rendering  
-  **Loops & Conditionals** – For pattern generation

---

##  Getting Started

###  Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher  
- Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or terminal with `javac`

###  Run a Pattern

```bash
# Compile a pattern file
javac PatternName.java

# Run the pattern
java PatternName
```

If you want, I can also:

 Combine all 11 patterns into a **single menu-driven Python project**
 Add **comments for school submission**
 Add **file saving, animation, or color output**

Just tell me!


> Add screenshots or terminal outputs to visually showcase your patterns.

##  Future Enhancements

-  Add GIFs or screenshots for each pattern  
-  Include explanations and logic breakdowns  
-  Host as a web-based pattern visualizer using JavaScript or Flask  
-  Add interactive CLI to choose and run patterns dynamically
